## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a java based real-time-traffic simulation. <br>

**Core functionalities** of the application include connecting to a running SUMO simulation, <br>
enabling real-time interaction between IDE and SUMO. <br>

Through a graphical user interface, the system visualizes road network, vehicles and traffic lights. <br>
For a clear overview the application includes a map auf the simulation with view of everything. <br>
The platform offers control such as vehicle injection on specific edges, adjustments of vehicle parameters and switching of traffic light phases. <br>
In addition the system collects and displays essential traffic stats like average speed and vehicle density ensuring the user can monitor and analyze traffic flow

### Motivation for the project
The **motivation** behind this project is to apply object-oriented programming and software engineering principles in a practical, real life scenario. <br>

### Milstone One
**Milestone 1** lays the foundation of the project by focusing on system design and initial prototyping. <br>
The team defines the overall architecture, prepares class designs for the TraaS wrapper (e.g., Vehicle, TrafficLight), and creates GUI mockups to illustrate the planned user interface. <br>
A first connection to SUMO is demonstrated, showing basic functionality such as listing traffic lights and stepping through the simulation. <br>
In addition, the technology stack is summarized, a Git repository is set up, and team roles are distributed to ensure clear responsibilities and efficient collaboration. <br>
